agentic_system_prompt = '\n# Agentic System Architecture\nAn agentic system consists of a directed graph with nodes and edges where:\n- Nodes are processing functions that handle state information\n- Edges define the flow of execution between nodes\n- The system has exactly one designated entry point (START or "__start__") and one finish point (END or "__end__").\n- State is passed between nodes and can be modified throughout execution\n\n## Tools\nTools are standalone functions registered with the system that agents can call.\nThey must have type annotations and a docstring, so the agents know what the tool does.\n```python\n# Example\ndef tool_function(arg1: str, arg2: int, ...) -> List[Any]:\n    """Tool to retrieve values\n\n    [descriptions of the inputs]\n    [description of the outputs]\n    """\n    # Process input and return result\n    return result\n```\n\nTools are NOT nodes in the graph - they are separate functions.\nYou can also call tools in nodes to separate concerns and keep the node\'s code organized.\n\n## Nodes\nA node is simply a Python function that processes state. There are two common patterns:\n\n1. **AI Agent Nodes**: Functions that use LargeLanguageModel models to process information:\n```python\n# Example\ndef agent_node(state):\n    llm = LargeLanguageModel(temperature=0.4) # Use this default model (wrapper around ChatOpenAI)\n    system_prompt = SYSTEM_PROMPT_AGENT1 # constant added to System Prompts section.\n    # Optionally bind tools that this agent can use\n    # This will automatically instruct the agent based on the tools docstrings\n    llm.bind_tools([tools["Tool1"], tools["Tool2"]])\n\n    # get message history, or other crucial information\n    messages = state.get("messages", [])\n    full_messages = [SystemMessage(content=system_prompt)] + messages\n\n    # Invoke the LargeLanguageModel with required information\n    response = llm.invoke(full_messages)\n\n    # Execute the tool calls from the agent\'s response\n    tool_messages, tool_results = llm.execute_tool_calls(response)\n\n    # You can now use tool_results programmatically if needed\n    # e.g., tool_results["Tool1"] contains the actual return values of Tool1\n\n    # Update state with both messages and tool results\n    new_state = {"messages": messages + [response] + tool_messages}\n\n    return new_state\n```\n\n2. **Function Nodes**: State processors:\n```python\n# Example\ndef function_node(state):\n    # Process state\n    new_state = state.copy()\n    # Make modifications to state\n    new_state["some_key"] = some_value\n    return new_state\n```\n\n## Edges\n1. **Standard Edges**: Direct connections between nodes\n2. **Conditional Edges**: Branching logic from a source node using router functions:\n```python\n# Example\ndef router_function(state):\n    # Analyze state and return next node name\n    last_message = str(state["messages"][-1])\n    if "error" in last_message.lower():\n        return "ErrorHandlerNode"\n    return "ProcessingNode"\n```\nRouter is a synonym for Conditional Edge.\n\n## State Management\n- The system maintains a state dictionary passed between nodes\n- Default state includes {\'messages\': \'List[Any]\'} for communication\n- Custom state attributes can be defined with type annotations\n- State is accessible to all components throughout execution, \n    but all attributes must be defined in advance, dynamically set state attributes cannot be accessed.\n'
function_signatures = '\nYou only have these decorators available for designing the system:\n```\n@@pip_install(package_name: str)\n    """\n        Securely installs a Python package using pip.\n            package_name: Name of the package to install e.g. "langgraph==0.3.5"\n    """\n@@set_imports(import_statements: List[str])\n    """\n        Sets the list of import statements for the target system.
