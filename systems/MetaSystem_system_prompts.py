agentic_system_prompt = '\n# Agentic System Architecture\nAn agentic system consists of a directed graph with nodes and edges where:\n- **Nodes**: These are Python functions that process and can modify the system\'s shared state.\n- **Edges**: These define the sequence of execution, directing the flow of data and control between nodes.\n- **Tools**: Standalone functions that perform specific tasks. Tools are not nodes themselves but can be invoked from within nodes.\n- The system always has a single entry point (START) and a single exit point (END).\n\n## Tools\nTools are standalone functions, registered with the system, designed to perform specific actions. They can be called by AI agents or invoked within nodes.\n For an AI agent to understand and use a tool effectively, the tool must have clear type annotations and a comprehensive docstring.\n```python\n# Example of a tool definition:\ndef tool_function(arg1: str, arg2: int, ...) -> List[Any]:\n    """Tool to retrieve values.\n\n    [Descriptions of the inputs]\n    [Description of the outputs]\n    """\n    # Process input and return result\n    return result\n```\n\nTools are NOT nodes in the graph - they are callable functions.\nThey can be invoked in two primary ways:\n\n**By AI Agents (LLM-driven)**:\nWhen a node uses a LargeLanguageModel, the LLM can decide to use available tools:\n```python\n# Binding tools to the LLM\nllm.bind_tools([tools["Tool1"], tools["Tool2"]])\n# The LLM then generates a response containing the tool_calls.\nresponse = llm.invoke(some_messages)\n# These tool_calls can be executed:\ntool_messages, tool_results = llm.execute_tool_calls(response)\n```\n**Programmatically within Node Code**:\nYou can also directly invoke a tool\'s functionality within any node.\nThis is useful for performing specific operations or for better organizing complex node logic.\n```python\n# tool.invoke() expects a dictionary containing the tool keyword arguments\nresult_from_tool1 = tools["Tool1"].invoke({"kwarg1": "some_value", "kwarg2": 123})\n# ... then use result_from_tool1 in the node\'s logic ...\n```\n\n## Nodes\nA node is a Python function that processes the system\'s state. There are two common patterns for nodes:\n\n1. **AI Agent Nodes**: Functions that leverage LargeLanguageModel instances to make decisions or generate content based on the current state.\n```python\n# Example of an AI Agent Node:\ndef agent_node(state):\n    llm = LargeLanguageModel(temperature=0.4) # Use this default model (wrapper around ChatOpenAI)\n\n    # Optionally bind tools that this agent can execute\n    llm.bind_tools([tools["Tool1"], tools["Tool2"]])\n\n    # Prepare messages for the LLM, typically including history and system instructions\n    messages = state.get("messages", [])\n    full_messages = [SystemMessage(content=system_prompt)] + messages\n\n    # Invoke the LargeLanguageModel with required information\n    response = llm.invoke(full_messages)\n\n    # Execute the tool calls from the agent\'s response\n    tool_messages, tool_results = llm.execute_tool_calls(response)\n\n    # You can now use tool_results programmatically if needed\n    # e.g., tool_results["Tool1"] contains the actual return values of Tool1\n\n    # Update the system state with the LLM\'s response and the tool interaction messages\n    new_state = {"messages": messages + [response] + tool_messages}\n    # Add any other state modifications based on tool_results or response.\n\n    return new_state\n```\n\n2. **Function Nodes**: Functions that perform state transformations or other non-AI operations.\n```python\n# Example of a Function Node:\ndef function_node(state):\n    # Process state\n    new_state = state.copy()\n    # Example: Increment a counter or transform data\n    new_state["processed_count"] = state.get("processed_count", 0) + 1\n    new_state["some_key"] = "transformed_" + str(state.get("some_key_input", ""))\n    return new_state\n```\n\n## Edges\nEdges define the control flow between nodes in the graph.\n\n1. **Standard Edges**: These create direct, unconditional connections from one node to another. \n    If NodeA has a standard edge to NodeB, NodeB will always execute after NodeA completes.\n2. **Conditional Edges (Routers)**: These allow for branching logic. \n    A conditional edge originates from a source node and uses a "router function" to decide which node to execute next based on the current state.\n```python\n# Example of a router function for a conditional edge:\ndef router_function(state):\n    # Analyze the current state to determine the next node\n    last_message_content = str(state.get("messages", [])[-1].content) if state.get("messages") else ""\n\n    if "error" in last_message_content.lower():\n        return "ErrorHandlerNode"  # Route to ErrorHandlerNode if an error is detected\n    elif "complete" in last_message_content.lower():\n        return END # Route to the graph\'s designated end point\n    else:\n        return "DefaultProcessingNode" # Otherwise, route to DefaultProcessingNode\n```\nRouter is a synonym for Conditional Edge.\n\n## State Management\n- The system revolves around a central state dictionary that is passed between nodes. Each node can read from and write to this state.\n- The state attribute, `{\'messages\': List[Any]}`, is included by default for conversational history and inter-node communication.\n- You can define custom state attributes with their Python type annotations.\n- All state attributes must be defined when the system\'s state structure (e.g., `AgentState(TypedDict)`) is declared.\n- Dynamically adding new keys to the state at runtime is not supported; only pre-defined attributes can be accessed and modified.\n'
