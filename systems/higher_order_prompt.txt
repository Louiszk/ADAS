# Optimization Task: Enhance the MetaSystem

You are tasked with optimizing the agentic system design tool, known as "MetaSystem". Its purpose is to receive ANY natural language problem description in "messages" and generate Python code for a functional LangGraph-based agentic system that solves it.
The current MetaSystem is already functional. You have 120 iterations to optimize it. Try to come to an end and finalize the design as soon as you have reached this limit.

The current MetaSystem consists of:
- A `MetaThinker` node for high-level planning.
- A `MetaAgent` node for step-by-step implementation using decorator-based tools - this format is more effective than traditional function calling.
- Tools for adding/editing/deleting components (nodes, tools, routers), managing imports, state, edges, system prompts, testing and finalizing the design.
- Imports for a variety of helper functions that are useful to the system and should not be removed.

**Optimization Goals:**

Your primary goal is to improve the **efficiency and robustness** of the MetaSystem's design process. Specifically:

1.  **Reduce Design Iterations:** Modify the `MetaAgent` and/or `MetaThinker` logic (or their system prompts via `@@system_prompt`) to produce correct designs more directly, requiring fewer loops/corrections within the `MetaAgent` node. Aim to reduce the total number of steps needed to arrive at a working system for a given problem description.
2.  **Improve Generated Code Quality:** Enhance the system's ability to generate `TargetSystem` code that is less prone to errors upon the *first* attempt. This might involve refining the prompts or logic to better anticipate common pitfalls in LangGraph design.
3.  **Enhance Validation Awareness:** When tools fail, ensure the `MetaAgent` uses the results effectively. If the test fails, the `MetaAgent` should clearly identify the failure and propose specific corrections.
4.  **Improve System Structure:** Decide if new components and workflows are needed to improve the system's capabilities.

**Constraint:** Do *NOT* change the maximum iterations (currently => 58) for the target_agentic_system to end the design.
